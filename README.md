JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used to create dynamic web content in Java. It allows developers to embed Java code directly into HTML pages, making it easier to develop web applications that can dynamically generate content based on user input, database queries, and other factors.

<h2>Here are some key features of JSP:</h2>

<hh5>Embedded Java Code:<h/5> JSP allows you to insert Java code into HTML using special tags. This Java code is executed on the server before the page is sent to the client's browser.

<h5>Tag Libraries:<h/5> JSP supports custom tags and tag libraries, which can be used to encapsulate complex operations or reusable components.

<h5>Expression Language (EL):<h/5> JSP includes an Expression Language that allows you to easily access data stored in Java objects, such as JavaBeans, without needing to write complex code.

<h5>JavaBeans Integration:<h/5> JSP can easily interact with JavaBeans components to manage the application's data.

<h5>JSP Directives:<h/5> These are instructions that provide global information about an entire JSP page, such as importing Java classes, defining custom tag libraries, or specifying the content type.

<h5>Lifecycle:<h/5> JSPs are compiled into servlets (Java classes that handle HTTP requests) by the server. The lifecycle of a JSP includes translation to a servlet, compilation, initialization, execution, and cleanup.
